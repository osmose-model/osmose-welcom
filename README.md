- Osmose documentation: https://www.documentation.osmose-model.org/
- Zenodo community: https://zenodo.org/communities/osmose/

## Repositories

Osmose code and resources are hosted on GitHub. The Osmose organization is accessible on https://github.com/osmose-model. It contains the following repositories:
- `osmose`: publicly accessible version of Osmose.
- `osmose-private`: privately accessible version of Osmose (ongoing developments)
- `osmose-doc`: Source code for the documentation (generated by Sphinx)
- `osmose-conda`: Instructions to build Conda environments for runniong Osmose.
- `osmose-cite-bibfile`: Contains bibtex entry for Osmose related papers which will appear on Osmose website.
- `osmose-eec`: Osmose configuration for the Eastern Channel (Morgane Travers-Trolet)
- `osmose-gog`: Osmose configuration for the Gulf of Gabbes (Ghassen Halouani)

## Softwares 

The following softwares are **required**:
- JAVA (https://www.java.com/fr/download/): programming language. Needed to run the Osmose model.
- Maven (https://maven.apache.org/): software project management and comprehension tool. Needed to compile Osmose (https://maven.apache.org/)
- NetCDF (https://www.unidata.ucar.edu/downloads/netcdf/): library for manipulating array-oriented scientific data. Needed by the Osmose model.
- R (https://www.r-project.org/): software environment for statistical computing and graphics. Needed to use the Osmose post-processing tools.

The following softwares are *strongly recommended*:
- RStudio (https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/): an integrated development environment for R. 
- Git (https://git-scm.com/downloads): version manager used to manage the code.
- Visual Studio (https://code.visualstudio.com/): code editor. 

Standard install instructions are given [here](http://www.documentation.osmose-model.org/astart.html), 
Conda install instructions are given [here](https://github.com/osmose-model/osmose-conda)

## Code management

The code is managed using Git Flow workflow (https://git-flow.readthedocs.io/fr/latest/presentation.html). The code is organized using the following branches:
- `master` (production branch): stable version of the code. Each commit of `master` is associated with a version number (`tag`). **Should not be updated directly**. 
- `develop` (development branch): contains all new developments.
- `feature/XXX` (feature branches): temporary branch dedicated to a certain task and that is ultimately merged with the `develop` branch
