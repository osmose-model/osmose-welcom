## Softwares 

The following softwares are strongly recommended:
- Git (https://git-scm.com/downloads): version manager used to manage the code.
- Visual Studio (https://code.visualstudio.com/): code editor

## Code management

The code is managed using Git Flow workflow (https://git-flow.readthedocs.io/fr/latest/presentation.html). The code is organized using the following branches:
- `master` (production branch): stable version of the code. Each commit of `master` is associated with a version number (`tag`). **Should not be updated directly**. 
- `develop` (development branch): contains all new developments.
- `feature/XXX` (feature branches): temporary branch dedicated to a certain task and that is ultimately merged with the `develop` branch
